# Ruby Programming -yet another tutorial-

Note
* This site describes 1. how to use Ruby and 2. what to do in Ruby for a programming language beginner. 
* The documents are written based on the Unix & macOS environment, not Windows, including Unix knowledge. 
* I would like to help such a person who wants to learn a programming language and at the same time to learn the technical terms in English to be ambicious to work in the world in future. 
* In contract, I would be also very glad if I could help you to learn Ruby and Japanese tegether.
