# Ruby Programming -yet another tutorial-

Note
* This site describes 1. how to use Ruby and 2. what to do in Ruby for a programming language beginner. 
* The documents are written based on Unix or macOS environment, not Windows. 
* I would like to help people who want to learn a programming language Ruby. 
* In addition, I would be glad if I could help you to learn Ruby and Japanese (language/culture) tegether.
